    <p>Born in Poland in 1967 during the Solidarity movement,
        he was inspired to create art that has the power to provoke discussions
        around complex social or political issues, ranging from war to economic
        disparity and the omnipotence of social media. One of his biggest influences 
        was from a book called "Front Line Poster" which was comprised of art printed
        by soldiers deep in the trenches of war. After he moved to the United States
        in 1990, he studied poster design and drawing which brings us to his more famous series. 
    </p>

    <p>He is currently famous for his series of COVID-19:Labor Camp Reports 
        which are drawings in black-and-white ink. These drawings are political
        statements of COVID reports, the response to the pain of the pandemic,
        various political issues and even covers sensitive topics such as police brutailty.
