    <h3>Briana Brownell - "How does artificial intelligence learn?"</h3>

        <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe
                src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/briana_brownell_how_does_artificial_intelligence_learn"

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>"Today, artificial intelligence helps doctors diagnose patients, pilots fly commercial aircraft, and city
        planners
        predict traffic. These AIs are often self-taught, working off a simple set of instructions to create a unique
        array of
        rules and strategies. So how exactly does a machine learn? Briana Brownell digs into the three basic ways
        machines
        investigate, negotiate, and communicate."</p>

    <h3>Janelle Shane - "The danger of AI is weirder than you think"</h3>
    <div style="max-width:854px">
        <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe
                src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/janelle_shane_the_danger_of_ai_is_weirder_than_you_think"
                width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0"
                scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    </div>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>"The danger of artificial intelligence isn't that it's going to rebel against us, but that it's going to do
        exactly what
        we ask it to do, says AI researcher Janelle Shane. Sharing the weird, sometimes alarming antics of AI algorithms
        as they
        try to solve human problems -- like creating new ice cream flavors or recognizing cars on the road -- Shane
        shows why AI
        doesn't yet measure up to real brains."</p>


    <h3>"How AI could become an extension of your mind"</h3>
    <div style="max-width:854px">
        <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe
                src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/arnav_kapur_how_ai_could_become_an_extension_of_your_mind" width="854"

    </div>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>"Try talking to yourself without opening your mouth, by simply saying words internally. What if you could search
        the
        internet like that -- and get an answer back? In the first live public demo of his new technology, TED Fellow
        Arnav
        Kapur introduces AlterEgo: a wearable AI device with the potential to let you silently talk to and get
        information from
        a computer system, like a voice inside your head."</p>
