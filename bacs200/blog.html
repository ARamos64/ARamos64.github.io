                    <hr>
                    <p>The pandemic has heavily impacted the working industry, from labor shortages, changes for women
                        in the workforce, shifts from offices
                        to homes, and the economic ripples caused by supplying issues.</p>
                    <h2 class="blog-underspace">Societal Impacts</h2>
                    <h4>Women and Families</h4>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p>"Nearly 1.8 million women have dropped out of the labor force amid the pandemic and are now
                            grappling with whether and
                            how to return to work in a vastly different landscape — one where some jobs have
                            disappeared, others are vulnerable to
                            automation, and nearly all involve some level of health risk."</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p><a
                            href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/22/coronavirus-pandemic-women-workforce-500329">Politico</a>
                    </p>
                    <p> Women in the workplace have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Most have lost
                        their jobs, or decided to
                        quit in order to take care of their families. As students were forced to do remote learning,
                        many mothers were forced to
                        stay at home as well to take care of the children forcing many families on one-person income.
                        Some of the women have
                        decided to re-enter the workforce but lower-income families, black and latino women have found
                        it
                        more difficult to find
                        sustainable jobs and be able to find affordable child care. On the other side this has allowed
                        for families to grow
                        closer and opened opportunities for some women due to remote-working. The shortage of people has
                        also forced employers
                        to raise wages and allowed an opening for the wage-gap to close.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="blog-underspace">Economic Impacts</h2>
                    <h4>Breaking the Supply-Demand Chain</h4>
                    <p>As the pandemic forced everyone into lockdown and the shut-down of non-essential places, this
                        also reduced spending and
                        production. This in turn created a shock from both sides of supply and demand. Some goods and
                        services were no longer
                        available like theaters, gyms or restaurants which forced many to be fired, furloughed or
                        laid-off. <img class="image-render"
                            src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQXh53aUNTMVGf0cqg7tQ-fm1SvgN_MXUK1lg&usqp=CAU"
                            style="margin: 10px 20px 10px 10px" alt="Closed Sign" /> However as places
                        began to open up again, demand skyrocketed past what could be done by the supply chain. Many
                        production companies had
                        halted or slowed during the pandemic especially in high-risk companies where it spread amongst
                        workers. The bottle-neck
                        in supply created higher prices such as in food as well as gouging and lack of products in
                        stores. Apart from the supply
                        and demand chain, there was also a shortage of workers. Many employers blamed the lack of
                        motivation to go back to work on higher
                        unemployment benefits but the underlying issues ran further than that. Workers voiced their
                        concerns about
                        operating during a high risk
                        pandemic and about low wages compared to the higher costs of living due to inflation. Many also
                        took the chance to
                        switch jobs toward better opportunities or getting an education.</p>
                    <h2 class="blog-underspace">Political Impacts</h2>
                    <h4>Political Responses and General Public Concerns</h4>
                    <p>Since Trump’s initial reaction to COVID-19 and his policies thereafter have shaped America into a
                        highly volatile place as well as created many issues and consequences. Many Republican
                        leaders have also followed in his footsteps
                        and have reopened many
                        places far too early, struck down mandatory face mask policies and allowed the spread and
                        mutation of the virus to run through
                        their citizens. This in turn has led to the deaths of thousands of Americans and the rejection
                        of both face masks and
                        the vaccines. In Democratic run states, studies have shown an 8% reduction of new cases. The
                        spread of misinformation
                        and destructive policies to please Republican voters has slowed general health and economic
                        recovery. However this has also opened the conversation to question the government about the
                        best interests of the people, opened eyes towards the impact of the working class, and
                        questioned the general public about what is best for their health.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="blog-underspace">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The pandemic has reshaped the world in both negative and positive ways. There were changes in the
                        workforce where some
                        people have lost jobs, others have directed themselves to new ones or towards an education and
                        others saw an opportunity
                        to advocate for better wages and benefits. The economy may be on a down-whirling spiral but many
                        nations are working
                        together to create policies to prevent turmoil and pave a path towards recovery. It put an
                        emphasis towards general
                        health and allowed families to grow closer than ever before. Despite the on-going struggles, it
                        has been the catalyst for change and
                        allowed for new
                        conversations to take place regarding work, the government, and economy.
