    <p>My name is Alejandra Ramos.
        I am a senior here at UNC studying for a bachelors in Visual Arts and Design
        with a concentration in Digital Media.
    </p>
    <p>I was born and raised here in Colorado but fortunately I've traveled
        outside the country to places like Japan and Canada before COVID. Despite
        that, I enjoy the mountains and hiking places here the most.
    </p>
    <p>I have some limited experience learning other coding languages such as
        python and java but I am excited to learn about web design and perhaps
        use it to make my own website in the future.
    </p>
